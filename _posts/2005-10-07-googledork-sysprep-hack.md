Not sure if you guys know what googledorks are. Basically custom google  
querys that find some interesting stuff. Johnny Long talks a lot more  
about them and has a whole database of them on his site  
<http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/.>

Now to the fun stuff. Not sure if this has been done or not but here it  
goes.

I was talking to someone about sysprep (things it does, options you can  
set, etc.)

Which got me thinking of my next idea.

GoogleDork:  
+&#8221;AdminPassword&#8221; | &#8220;DomainAdmin&#8221; | &#8220;DomainAdminPassword&#8221;  
inurl:sysprep.inf 

I know this is a pretty simple googledork(but you would be amazed at  
the findings). If anyone has a better way of doing it or expanding it,  
I would love to see it.
