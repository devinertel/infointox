I am an Information Security addict with over 10 years of generalist experience with a concentration in offensive security. I am the founder of <a href="http://www.sutrosec.com" target="_blank">Sutrosec</a>, a specialized security consulting company. Additionally, I helped co-found the security consulting company <a href="http://www.redteamsecure.com" target="_blank">RedTeam Security</a>, and have been the technical editor for multiple security books including both of the <a href="http://thehackerplaybook.com" target="_blank">The Hackers Playbook&#8217;s</a>. I am active in the security community and try to contribute as much as I can. Contributions include starting the DEF CON group dc414 and creating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackbay" target="_blank">/r/hackbay</a> to foster my local security communities . This is only my personal security scrapbook, my response to comments may be slow.
